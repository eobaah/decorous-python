# Description
Build a website for a local organization.

Find an organization in your local community that has a website. It could be a business, a non-profit, a sports team, a community center, or something else in that vein.

This will be your source of content. Then, design and build a new site for the organization. You can use the same content (text and images) to populate the site, but come up with a different design.

If the site you pick has more than 3 pages, aim to build at least 3 of the most important pages (e.g. "Home", "About", "Contact").

## Context
A common job for web designers and developers working in consultancies or as freelancers is to redesign an existing site. Whether because they've become buggy, are poorly designed, or have gone out of style, websites occasionally need to be refreshed.

Practicing with pre-existing content is a great way to focus on the structure and style of the site.

As you work on this goal, consider these questions:

What is the best way to package and display different types of content?
When content needs to be re-used in different places, how can templates and/or components be deployed to avoid duplicating code?
Why is browser compatibility important and what are some ways to test for it?
